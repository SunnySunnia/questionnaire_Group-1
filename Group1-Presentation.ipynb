      "In our very first collaborative project, we used data from our class (Stat 157) that we generated from filling out the course's introductory questionnaire through Google survey framework. The questionnaire contained questions that sought to find out more about each individual student's background coming into the class. Questions included what classes we had taken before, what skills we were comfortable with, what our learning styles were, as well as several others.\n",

I searched for responses with \u201cinternships, work or jobs\u201d and put that in the work category. I searched for responses with \u201cclass and course\u201d and placed them in the class category. I searched for responses with \u201c personal and friends\u201d and put them in the social category. I eliminated crossovers within 1 group (a response with \u201cinternship\u201d and \u201cwork\u201d would be counted once in the work category. There remains crossovers between groups, but I just wanted to see relative ratios and its perfectly reasonable to say you learned the material in two environments.  Overall, I found 21 put Social, 14 put work, and 10 put class as their primary method of learning the material. There appears a higher concentration in self-motivated study, implying the group as a whole is genuinely interested in the field of collaborative and reproducible data."
