Instructions:
--------------------
[Group1-Presentation.ipynb](https://github.com/SunnySunnia/questionnaire_Group-1/blob/master/Group1-Presentation.ipynb) contains the presentation for this project. Inside it has code that cleans the data, analyzes it, and creates visualizations for it. 

Please download extra packages for python:
- `sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib`
- `sudo apt-get install python-tornado`

Please launch your ipython notebook on webbrowser through this code:
`ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --pylab inline`

We did some of our data processing in R and created some csv files, so our visualizations are based on the csv files imported. Corresponding R-codes(named as HW2R.R) can be found in this repository.
To replicate the work done in R, please have R version 3.0 installed.
